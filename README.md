# 🧠 AIstylist Proof of Concept

A Python tool that automatically trims clothing images and composites them onto avatar illustrations. This project aims to create a simple yet effective way to visualize clothing items on virtual avatars.

## ✨ Features

- Automatic clothing image trimming
- Avatar-clothing compositing
- Simple command-line interface
- Organized project structure for easy development

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```
minimal.py         # Core logic for image processing
input/             # Place your avatar and clothing images here
output/            # Composite image output
results/           # Save logs or future outputs here
data/              # Optional input data (not used in current script)
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages (will be listed in requirements.txt)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/1231-arisa/minimal.git
cd minimal
```

2. Install dependencies (when requirements.txt is added):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage

1. Place your images in the `input/` folder:
   - Avatar image (e.g., `avatar.png`)
   - Clothing image (e.g., `Navyshirt.jpg`)

2. Run the script:
```bash
python minimal.py
```

3. Check the `output/` folder for the composite image

## 🔮 Future Plans

- [ ] Add support for multiple clothing items
- [ ] Implement automatic background removal
- [ ] Add GUI interface
- [ ] Support for different avatar poses
- [ ] Batch processing capability
