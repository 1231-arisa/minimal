# üß† AIstylist Proof of Concept (minimal.py)

This tool trims (crops) clothing images and fits them onto an avatar illustration. It is a minimal prototype for compositing real clothing photos onto an avatar.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
```
minimal.py         # Core logic for image processing
input/             # Place your avatar and clothing images here
output/            # Composite image output
results/           # Save logs or future outputs here
data/              # Optional input data (not used in current script)
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
```bash
python minimal.py
```
Make sure you put your avatar image (e.g. avatar.png) and clothing image (e.g. Navyshirt.jpg) in the `input/` folder before running the script.
